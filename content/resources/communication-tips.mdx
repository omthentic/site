Medical interviews can be daunting, but mastering these five essential communication techniques will help you present your best self.

## Why Communication Matters

Communication isn't just about what you say—it's about how you say it, when you say it, and how well you listen.

<Callout type="info" title="Research Shows">
  Studies indicate that 55% of communication is non-verbal, 38% is tone of voice, and only 7% is the actual words spoken.
</Callout>

## The 5 Essential Techniques

<Step number={1} title="Active Listening">

Before you can respond effectively, you must truly understand the question.

**Key practices:**
- Maintain eye contact
- Nod to show engagement
- Don't interrupt
- Ask clarifying questions if needed

  The best candidates are those who listen carefully and respond thoughtfully, not those who rush to answer.
</BlockQuote>

</Step>

<Step number={2} title="Structure Your Response">

Use the STAR method to organize your thoughts:

- **S**ituation: Set the context
- **T**ask: Describe the challenge
- **A**ction: Explain what you did
- **R**esult: Share the outcome

</Step>

<Step number={3} title="Show Empathy">

Demonstrate your ability to understand others' perspectives.

<ProsCons 
  pros={[
    "Acknowledge emotions explicitly",
    "Use phrases like 'I understand...' or 'That must have been...'",
    "Connect your experiences to others' feelings"
  ]}
  cons={[
    "Don't over-identify or make it about you",
    "Avoid dismissive phrases like 'I know how you feel'",
    "Don't rush to solutions without acknowledgment"
  ]}
/>

</Step>

<Step number={4} title="Manage Your Pace">

Speaking too quickly can make you seem nervous; too slowly can lose engagement.

**Tips:**
- Take a breath before answering
- Pause between major points
- Watch for interviewer cues
- Practice with a timer

<InlineNote>Aim for 120-150 words per minute</InlineNote>

</Step>

<Step number={5} title="Read the Room">

Pay attention to non-verbal cues from your interviewer:

- Leaning forward = interested
- Checking watch = time to wrap up
- Nodding = continue
- Confused expression = clarify

</Step>

## Practice Makes Perfect

These techniques require practice to become natural. Here's how to improve:

1. **Record yourself** answering common questions
2. **Get feedback** from peers or mentors
3. **Use AI tools** like Omthentic for objective analysis
4. **Practice regularly** - consistency is key
